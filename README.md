# Infinitely Deep Bayesian Neural Networks with SDEs

This library contains JAX and Pytorch implementations of neural ODEs and Bayesian layers for stochastic variational inference. A rudimentary JAX implementation of differentiable SDE solvers is also provided, refer to [torchsde](https://github.com/google-research/torchsde) for a full set of differentiable SDE solvers in Pytorch.
